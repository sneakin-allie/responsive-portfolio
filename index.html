        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Allison Schulman.</p>

        <p>I'm a web developer living in Connecticut for the time being until moving west for my next adventure.</p>

        <p>I most recently lived in San Francisco, California for 8 years before leaving in May 2020 to spend time with family in New Mexico, Colorado, and Connecticut. I'll be moving back west and finding a place to settle in early 2021.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item2">
          <p>I graduated from the University of Connecticut with an Environmental Biology degree and have always been facinated with math and science.</p>

          <p>After graduation, I craved adventure and moved out west to San Francisco, California. I worked in tech for a handful of years until moving into the non-profit industry in an effort to contribute to the community around me in a meaningful way. Most recently, I managed a Resource Center for individuals in the healthcare safety net, helping them overcome social-economic barriers and reach their life goals.</p>

          <p>As my life changed this year, I became more curious about web development and decided to enroll in Bloc's online program (best decision ever!). I'm thrilled to be challenging myself, building new skills, and exercising the logic and problem-solving parts of my brain again. I'm looking forward to joining a team and diving deeper into web development!</p>
